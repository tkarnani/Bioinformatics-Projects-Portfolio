Welcome to my bioinformatics projects site. This is where I collect coursework, side projects, and experiments in computational biology as an undergraduate at UC San Diego.​

I’m interested in genomics, data visualization, and using R and Python to explore biological data.

This site is a living portfolio where I document what I’m learning, from basic sequence analysis to more advanced methods, including a Python package to identify enriched motifs.

## Projects

1. ***BLAST-like Alignment Tools*** - Developed a Python-based local sequence alignment pipeline inspired by Smith–Waterman and BLAST. Implemented a configurable local alignment algorithm with BLAST-like output, a random DNA sequence generator, and simulation scripts to study how scoring parameters and sequence length affect expected alignment length between random sequences. Built an iterative BLAST-style search with score thresholds and visualization of hit frequency, and analyzed experimental results across parameter sweeps. This project strengthened my understanding of dynamic programming for sequence alignment, statistical behavior of random alignments, and practical tradeoffs in bioinformatics search algorithms.

2. ***Local Alignment and Seed-and-Extend heuristics*** - Implemented a local sequence alignment tool with configurable scoring and BLAST-like output, and extended it with a seed-and-extend heuristic designed for larger, more realistic biological databases. Built an l-mer indexing and matching pipeline to identify seed matches, cluster proximal hits, extend alignments, and filter results by score thresholds, while benchmarking performance across different seed lengths. This project deepened my understanding of local alignment algorithms, BLAST-style heuristics, and the tradeoffs between sensitivity, runtime, and seed size in large-scale sequence search.

3. ***MotifSeeker*** - Developed MotifSeeker, a Python command-line tool for identifying enriched DNA motifs from genomic peak data. The tool takes BED peak files and a reference genome FASTA to detect significantly enriched motifs, emulating core functionality of the HOMER motif analysis pipeline. Implemented statistical enrichment testing with user-defined p-value thresholds, sequence processing, and motif visualization, and packaged the tool for command-line use. This project strengthened my experience with genomic data formats (BED/FASTA), motif discovery workflows, statistical analysis of sequence data, and building reproducible bioinformatics software.

4. ***RNA-seq Differential Expression and Pathway Analysis*** - Performed a full RNA-seq analysis on public GEO data (GSE37704) to investigate transcriptional changes in lung fibroblasts following HOXA1 knockdown. Conducted differential expression analysis using DESeq2, generated diagnostic and volcano plots, and annotated significant genes with Ensembl, Entrez, and gene symbols. Extended the analysis with pathway and gene set enrichment using KEGG, GO Biological Processes, and Reactome-style workflows (gage, pathview), identifying strong enrichment of cell cycle and mitotic pathways. This project strengthened my experience with RNA-seq data processing, statistical modeling of count data, functional enrichment analysis, and interpretation of transcriptomic results in a biological context.

5. ***Data Visualization*** - Developed exploratory and explanatory data visualizations using R and ggplot2 to analyze biological and socioeconomic datasets. Projects included visualizing gene expression changes under drug treatment and examining global relationships between GDP, population, and life expectancy using the Gapminder dataset. Emphasized effective aesthetic mapping, faceting, and scaling to communicate trends clearly, while comparing ggplot2’s grammar-of-graphics approach to base R plotting.

6. ***Machine Learning Fundamentals*** - Implemented core machine learning techniques including k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) on synthetic and real-world datasets. Explored cluster structure, distance metrics, and dimensionality reduction through hands-on analysis and visualization, including PCA of UK food consumption data. Gained practical experience interpreting clustering results, variance explained, and trade-offs in unsupervised learning methods.

7. ***Unsupervised Machine Learning*** - Applied unsupervised learning techniques to uncover structure in multivariate data, focusing on clustering and dimensionality reduction without labeled outcomes. Designed experiments using k-means, hierarchical clustering, and PCA to evaluate pattern separation, parameter sensitivity, and interpretability. Strengthened understanding of how unsupervised methods are used for exploratory data analysis in biological and high-dimensional datasets.
