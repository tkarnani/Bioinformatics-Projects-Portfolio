Welcome to my bioinformatics projects site. This is where I collect coursework, side projects, and experiments in computational biology as an undergraduate at UC San Diego.​

I’m interested in genomics, data visualization, and using R and Python to explore biological data.

This site is a living portfolio where I document what I’m learning, from basic sequence analysis to more advanced methods, including a Python package to identify enriched motifs.
